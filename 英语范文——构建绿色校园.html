<p>&nbsp; <span style="font-size: 14pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;">In recent years, extravagance and waste have become increasingly serious in some of the university campus. We can see that papers, bottles and cans are thrown away after use; food is wasted just because of its poor taste; clothes are discarded simply owing to their old fashion. As a consequence, people in mounting numbers put great emphasis on creating a green campus.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; There are at least two criteria to distinguish what is green campus. On the one hand, natural resources must be conserved and made full use of, for example, we, as college students, should take the wise use of papers and second-hand textbooks into account. On the other hand, education to build up thrifty habits must be promoted by relevant departments and professionals at various levles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Accordingly, it is necessary for us to take effective steps. For one thing, university authorities should make a regulation on the prohibition of waste and extravagance and a corresponding punishment to those undesirable behaviors. For another, the awareness of college students to create a green campus should be enhanced. It is our joint efforts that play a decisive role in determining our prosperous future. Light tomorrow with today.</span></p>
