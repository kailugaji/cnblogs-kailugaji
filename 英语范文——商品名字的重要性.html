<p><span style="font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; When it comes to the topic of the importance of a name of commodities, it goes without saying that the viewpoints differ from person to person. Some people hold that the name of products is increasingly playing a significant role in the recent fiercely competitive market. A good case in point is that in sports industry the sports facilities with famous brand like ADIDAS, NIKE and so on are usually more attractive to consumers than those with common brand. Therefore, the name of commodities has become a key card that the businessman must play so as to beat their commercial rivals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Meanwhile, other people claim that the importance of the name of products is over-stressed. They focus the most of attention on the practical value of commodities instead of the name of that. In their eyes, if the commodities with sound quality can meet the demands of life, there is no need to waste money to purchase those so-called famous brands. Thus, they don&rsquo;t take the name of products seriously in reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; As far as I am concerned, there is probably some truth in both statements. But we should not go to extremes, that is to say, we should deal with the relationship between the name and the practical value in a balanced way according to our living condition. Only in this way can we make the best use of our income to improve our living quality.</span></p>
